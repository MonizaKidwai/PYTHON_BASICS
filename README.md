Python Basics â€“ Quick Overview
Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language known for its readability and versatility. Here's a concise breakdown of its core concepts:
- Variables: Used to store data such as numbers, text, or collections.
- Data Types: Includes integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- Operators: Perform arithmetic, comparisons, and logical operations.
- Conditional Statements: Allow decision-making using if, elif, and else.
- Loops: Used to repeat actions with for and while loops.
- Functions: Reusable blocks that perform specific tasks and return results.
- Collections: Lists (ordered and mutable), Tuples (ordered and immutable), Dictionaries (key-value pairs), and Sets (unordered and unique).
- Strings: Text data with built-in methods for formatting and manipulation.
- File Handling: Enables reading from and writing to external files.
- Exception Handling: Manages errors gracefully using try and except.
- Modules & Packages: Allow code reuse and organization by importing built-in or custom functionality.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Models real-world entities using classes and objects.
